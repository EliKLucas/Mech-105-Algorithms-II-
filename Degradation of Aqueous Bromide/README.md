The photodegradation of aqueous bromide for an particular setup is expected to follow the function:

c = 4.84e^(-0.034t)

- c is the concentration in ppm (parts per million)

- t is the time (minutes)

This function creates a plot of measured experimental data (represented with red diamonds) alongside a line of the expected function (represented with a green dashed line)

The first 70 minutes of the experiment are plotted, with one point for every 30 seconds

A legend and label axes are also created
