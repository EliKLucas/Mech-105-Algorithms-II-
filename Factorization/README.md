Function that finds the inverse of an inputed matrix, and tracks pivots with L matrix

Inputs: A- coefficient matrix (matrix being factored)

Outputs:

L - lower triangular matrix, with 1's along the diagonals that get shifted as pivots are performed

U - upper triangular matrix, inverse of inputted matrix A

P - the pivot matrix, which tracks multiplyers
