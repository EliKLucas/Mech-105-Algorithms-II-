This script determines the volume of a cylindrical tank that becomes cone-like at the top, as well as the volume of water within this tank given the height of this water
- The height of the water is set to 20m

- The cone diameter is set to 46

- The cylander diameter is set to 25

- The cone height is set to 14

- The cylander diameter is set to 19

- The cylander radius is set to (cylander diameter/2)

This script calculates the volume of the tank given these parameters, initializing variable "v" with this value

This program detects illogical inputs, such as a height of 46m
