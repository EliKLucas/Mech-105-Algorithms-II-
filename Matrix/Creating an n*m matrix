function [A] = specialMatrix(n,m)
% This function should return a matrix A as described in the problem statement
% Inputs n is the number of rows, and m the number of columns
% It is recomended to first create the matrxix A of the correct size, filling it with zeros to start with is not a bad choice
if (nargin ~=2)
    error
end
A = zeros(n,m)
spot = 1
while (spot~=m+1)
    A(1,spot) = spot
    spot = spot+1
end
spot = 1
while (spot~=n+1)
    A(spot,1) = spot
    spot = spot+1
end

% Now the real challenge is to fill in the correct values of A
for r = 2:n
    for c = 2:m
        %A(r,c) = A(r,c-1)+A(r-1,c-1)
        A(r,c) = A(r-1,c)+A(r,c-1)
    end
end
%A = [1 2 3 4 5; 2 3 5 7 9; 3 5 8 12 16; 4 8 13 20 28]
disp(A)

end
